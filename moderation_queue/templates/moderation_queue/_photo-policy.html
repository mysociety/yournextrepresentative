<h2>Photo policy</h2>

<p><strong>The photo must be a clear, recent, colour headshot of the candidate.</strong></p>

<p>
  No text or party logos may be included in the photo, unless an unavoidable
  part of the background or a small rosette/badge that doesn’t interfere with
  the rule above. Any photo containing party text or logos should be replaced
  by a plain photo whenever one is available.
