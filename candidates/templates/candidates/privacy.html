<h3>Simple Version</h3>

<p>This site is run
by <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/">Democracy
Club</a>.</p>

<p>We make the following promises about your personal
information as a user of the site:<p>

<ul>

<li>We will not sell or distribute your email address or other
personal information.</li>

<li>We will gladly show you the personal data we store about you
in order to run the website.</li>

</ul>

<p>We may use your email address to contact you about your use
of the site if it's problematic (or particularly helpful!), or
with occasional announcements about YourNextMP and other
Democracy Club projects.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>As well as your login details, we store your IP address along
with any changes you make to the data on the site.  All this
information is accessible to administrators of the site.</p>

<p>Please note that this policy refers to the personal
information arising from creating a login on the site, not the
personal information about candidates for elections -
the reason for the site to exist is to make information about
those candidates available to members of the public and website
developers so that they can find out more about those
candidates, their promises and policy positions.</p>

<p>We also use Google Analytics to aggregate and track data
about usage of the site; you can
use <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">a
browser plugin to opt out of having data collected by Google
Analytics.</a></p>
